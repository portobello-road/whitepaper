\epigraph{
  But when you come right down to it the reason that we did this job is because
  it was an organic necessity. If you are a scientist you cannot stop such a thing.
  If you are a scientist you believe that it is good to find out how the world works;
  that it is good to find out what the realities are; that it is good to turn over
  to mankind at large the greatest possible power to control the world and to deal
  with it according to its lights and its values. 
}{Robert Oppenheimer\\2 Nov 1945}
