\epigraph{
The open society, the unrestricted access to knowledge, the unplanned and
uninhibited association of men for its furtherance â€” these are what may
make a vast, complex, ever growing, ever changing, ever more specialized
and expert technological world, nevertheless a world of human community.
}{Robert Oppenheimer\\Science and the Common Understanding\\1953}
