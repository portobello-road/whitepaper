% Welcome to 'Portobello Road' fellow explorer. The document source code is
% typeset using mostly standard LaTeX with some widely used AMS extensions.

% Read through linearly and you'll find comments like these guiding you through
% the source code so that it will be easy to make changes even if you've not
% worked with LaTeX before and to make it as easy as possible to learn more
% about LaTeX.

% If you have any questions about specific syntax or tags a good strategy is to
% use google and search for the syntax or function you're curious about followed
% by 'LaTeX' with that exact capitalisation. See the WikiBooks article at
% http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Introduction for an excellent introduction
% to LaTeX.

% We're currently in the part of the LaTeX document, herein referred to simply
% as the document, which is known as the 'Preamble'.
% See http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Document_Structure for more information
% about how this document is structured. We'll refer to terms defined there
% from time to time throughout this document.

% At this point in the Preamble we begin rendering system initialization.

% The \input tag is a function which includes the contents of the file
% specified just as if they had been copy and pasted right into this file.
% The file path is relative to the project root. 
\input{config/init/system.tex}

% define terms used throughout the text that may be jargon or usage specific
% these are non-printing entries used later in the document
\input{content/portobello_road/glossaries/default/entries.tex}

% Here we create a new document context using the matching \begin and \end
% tags. Inside this context we will declare our Top Matter and the rest of
% the work.
